                    <span class="subtitle_text">What is WPILL?</span>
                    <p>First established in 1992, WPILL is a journal for undergraduate and graduate
                    students in the GMU English Department who are seeking to bring their work
                    to publication in academic journals.</p>
                    <span class="subtitle_text">How does it work?</span>
                    <p>Through a rigorous peer review process (by your actual peers), WPILL seeks to
                    familiarize students with the academic publication process. Published once a
                    year, the journal is open to all topics related to languge use and utilizes both
                    APA and MLA formats.</p>
                    <span class="subtitle_text">Is this something I can list on my CV?</span>
                    <p>Absolutely! If accepted, your blind peer-reviewed article will be published (digitally) and freely available on the
                    website. You can check out previous issues and articles from the Archive tab in the nav bar.</p>
                    <span class="subtitle_text">How long does this process take?</span>
                    <p>Of course, scholarly journals vary widely in their timelines for review and publication, and many are notorious for
                    their slow pace. Our timeline aims to be much quicker, with submission to publication (if accepted) taking around 3-4 months. 
                    Check our submissions page for the current submissions timeline.</p>
                    <span class="subtitle_text">If accepted, can I then go on to work on the paper further and submit it somewhere else?</span>
                    <p>Yes. Working Papers is a common concept in academia, and in fact, Mason has two other Working Paper journals (one in
                    <a href="https://ices.gmu.edu/working-papers">Economics</a> and one in <a href="https://www.law.gmu.edu/pubs/papers/">Law</a>). 
                    While these journals vary in their intent and makeup, they all share the same purpose:
                    publication of a "working draft" which is preliminary in form and subject to revision before publication in scholarly
                    journals. We understand this can be a puzzling concept to think about at first, and we are happy to discuss further with
                    anyone who might have concerns.</p>
                    <span class="subtitle_text">Who are the peer reviewers?</span>
                    <p>We have recruited current and former students from the Linguistics and Writing & Rhetoric programs to blindly review
                    work for the journal. As a result, our reviewers remain anonymous. Please don't try and figure out who they are!</p>
