# WPILL
This is a repository of the source files for a website to support/host the Working Papers in Language and Linguistics (WPILL), a student-led inter-departmental journal at George Mason university. Through a collaboration between the Linguistics and the Writing & Rhetoric programs, the journal was brought back into service after nearly 10 years and has since published 2 issues (Spring 2022, Fall 2023).
