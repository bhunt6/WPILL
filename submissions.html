                <p>The intent behind Working Papers in Language and Linguistics is to provide
                a support structure beyond coursework for students to work toward publication.
                The papers are in preliminary form and subject to revision before publication in
                scholarly journals. Accordingly, the editors ask that you consult with your professor
                for suggestions for improvements/revisions before submitting your paper. Once you
                and your professor are satisfied with the paper, you can submit to the Editors in
                PDF or DOCX format.</p>
                <p>The interests and work of both undergraduate and graduate students in the English
                department varies widely, and while WPILL is open to submissions of all types, topics
                most suitable for the journal revolve around research on or about language including
                analysis or metalinguistic analysis of language use in the following topics - writing,
                literacy, literature, linguistics, language learning, pedagogy, technical communication,
                and rhetoric. WPILL is especially interested in data-focused submissions which revolve
                around novel analysis of data or submissions with a specific and explicit research focus.
                If you have questions about the suitability of your topic or proposed topic or paper,
                please contact the editors prior to submission.</p>
                <p>As a departmental publication, WPILL aims to mimic the experience of submitting to a
                scholarly journal in order to give students exposure to the peer-review process. As a
                result, if selected, your paper will be subject to a double-blind peer review, the results
                of which will be shared with submitting authors by the 1/31 deadline. If accepted, or
                accepted with revisions, you will then have two months (until 3/1) to make those
                revisions prior to publication. All submissions, even those which may be rejected or
                advised to revise and resubmit, will receive substantive feedback from multiple reviewers.
                As a note â€“ submissions do not strictly have to emanate out of course work.</p>
                <p>We request that authors follow the one-sheet style guide included below. As a
                departmental publication meant to serve students with a variety of publication goals,
                we have tried to accommodate both APA and MLA format.</p>

                <p>In addition to our style, we ask that you anonymize your paper (generally, this means
                to replace every instance of your own name in the paper with "Author"), and include
                an abstract composed of no more than 300 words. We also ask that submitted papers
                be between 12-18 pages in length including the cover page and works cited (as well as
                any appendices).</p>
